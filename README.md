# Project Repository Lab

Now that you have reviewed a sample repository, identified concerns, and used the terminal and GitHub to align the repository with industry expectations, it is time to apply this knowledge to your own projects.

## Review Your Own Project Repository

Review a repository from a Flatiron School project, and use the following questions to create a to-do list:

- Are the names of your repository and files informative?
- Have you added a project description on GitHub?
- Is there a `.gitignore` file?
- Are all the appropriate files ignored, removed, and not tracked (like `.ipynb_checkpoints`)?
- Are all excessive data files removed from your repository?
- Is there a folder for images, and are all similar files saved in the same place?
- Are there any files stored at the top level of the directory that you do not want an potential employer to see? Could those files be moved to a lower directory?

## Make Changes
Work through the to-do list of changes to reorganize your project repository. Remember to use `git` commands so those changes show up on remote versions (`git mv` instead of just `mv`, for example).
