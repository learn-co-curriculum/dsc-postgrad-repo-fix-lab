# Project Repository Lab

Now that you have reviewed a sample repository, identified concerns, and used the terminal to align the repository with industry expectations; it is time to apply this knowledge to your own projects.

## Review project repository
Review a repository from a Flatiron School project and use the following questions to create a to-do list:
- Are the names of your repository and files informative?
- Is there a `gitignore` file?
- Are all the appropriate files ignored and not tracked?
- Is all the data removed from your repository?
- Are there folders and directories for images or are all files saved in the same place?
- Are there any files stored at the top level of the directory that you do not want an potential employer to see? Could those files be moved to a lower directory?

## Work through making changes
Work through the to-do list of changes to reorganize your project repository. Remember to use `git` commands so those changes show up on remote versions along with locally.
